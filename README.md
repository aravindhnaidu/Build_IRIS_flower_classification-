# Build_IRIS_flower_classification-
To classify IRIS flowers, use pattern recognition models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines. 
Train these models on labeled data (sepal/petal measurements) to learn distinguishing features.
After training, the model can predict the species of new flowers based on their measurements.
